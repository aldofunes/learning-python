1. Considering the following code:

```python
answer = 3.14 <= 3.14
```

What would the value of 'answer' be?



2. What would be printed out in the shell after this statement is evaluated?

```python
"python" > "chocolate"
```

3. To check and see if two values are not equal to each other you use the following operator:

- !=
- ~=
- <=

4. 

Given the following code:

```python
age = int(input("What is your age?  "))
if age < 13:
    print("Sorry you are not old enough to see this PG-13 movie")
else:
    print("Welcome to the movie")
```

What would be printed out to the console if the user entered 13?
